## Contents of this repository

The directory [`articles`](articles) contains the LaTeX source code of the article submitted to ReScience.

The directory [`reproduction`](reproduction) contains the code and data for the reproduction. In [`scripts-from-suplementary-material-to-original-paper`](scripts-from-suplementary-material-to-original-paper) you can find a copy of the scripts plus instructions that were deposited as supplementary material in 2008. An updated version that was available from my personal Web site for a few years is preserved in [`updated-scripts-from-obsolete-web-server`](updated-scripts-from-obsolete-web-server). It contains a bug fix that is not relevant for this reproduction, but matters for applying the code to other protein crystals.

The file [`notes`](notes.org) contains many technical details that are not in the article, in particular the commands to execute for a bit-by-bit reproduction, and the exhaustive lists of software packages (with version numbers) that enter into the computations.
