# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "Reproduction attempt of K. Hinsen, Structural flexibility in proteins: impact
           of the crystal environment, Bioinformatics 24:521 (2008). The code published
           with the original article could be modified to work on a modern computer,
           and produced sufficiently similar results. However, it proved insufficient
           for a complete replication of all the results."
